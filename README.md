# Weimar Elections Insights

A comprehensive analysis of Nazi party support across different demographics during the Weimar Republic elections, based on the 2008 Harvard Study "Ordinary Economic Voting Behavior in the Extraordinary Election of Adolf Hitler."

## üìä Project Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts and Python visualizations that analyze estimated Nazi party voting patterns by:
- **Social Class**: Unemployed, Blue-collar, White-collar, Self-employed, and Domestic workers
- **Religion**: Protestant vs Catholic populations

The data comes from Harvard Dataverse and represents statistical estimates derived from electoral and census data analysis.

  - Generates religious breakdown analysis
  - Includes data cleaning and standardization
- `Weimar-1.py`: Social class analysis visualization
  - Creates line plots showing Nazi support trends across 5 social classes
  - Population-weighted calculations using 1933 demographic data

## üìà Key Findings Visualized

- **Social Class Patterns**: Different levels of Nazi support across occupational groups
- **Religious Divide**: Comparative analysis of Protestant vs Catholic voting behavior  
- **Historical Context**: 1933 elections marked as "not free or fair"
- **Population Weighting**: Accurate representation based on actual demographic distributions

## ‚ö† Important Notes

- **Data Nature**: These are statistical estimates, not direct historical records
- **Methodology**: Based on Harvard academic research combining multiple data sources
- **Uncertainty**: Expected degree of uncertainty in historical estimates
- **Context**: Analysis focuses on democratic elections before Nazi consolidation of power

- **Dark Theme**: Somber styling appropriate for historical subject matter
- **Peak Annotations**: Highlights maximum support levels (excluding unfair 1933 elections)
- **Population Statistics**: Embedded demographic data for context
- **Data Attribution**: Clear sourcing and methodology disclaimers
- **Professional Quality**: High-resolution exports suitable for academic use

## üìö Academic Context

This analysis supports historical research into:
- Economic factors in political extremism
- Religious influences on voting behavior
- Social class dynamics in democratic breakdown
